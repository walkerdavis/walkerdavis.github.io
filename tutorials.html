									<h2>Creative Side-Chaining and Envelope Following Part 4: Filtering</h2>

								</header>

								<p>
									The Auto Filter does not provide any visual feedback of its own, so I will have Ableton’s Spectrum Audio Effect/Tool to illustrate what I am demonstrating.
									<br>

									(The Auto Filter in Ableton 9.7 does have a ‘Drive’ parameter that does effect Gain/Amplitude when you select something other than the ‘Clean’ Filter Type, but I will not be discussing it here.)<br>
									<br>
									<br>


									1. Configure ‘Chainer’ and ‘Chained’ signal(s). <br>
									-Sounds that have short attack-times, like kick and snare drums, work really well for ‘Chainer’ signals.<br>
									-Longer sounds like guitar, keyboards, synths, and reverbs work well as ‘Chained’ signals.<br>
									-Grouping multiple Audio and MIDI tracks together, Command-G, will allow you to make the effect more obvious.<br>
									<br>

									2. Put the Auto Filter Audio Effect on the ‘Chained’ track or group<br>
									<br>

									3. Routing within the Auto Filter<br>
									-Press the Arrow icon in the top left of the Audio Filter Audio Effect<br>
									-Press the ‘SideChain’ button, it is On when the button is Yellow<br>
									-In the dropdown menu, select the ‘Chainer’ track<br>
									<br>

									4. Input Parameters<br>
									<u>Gain</u> will control how much the ‘Chainer’ signal effects the Auto Filter<br>
									<br>

									5. Filter Parameters<br>
									<u>Frequency</u> specifies the Cutoff Frequency of the Auto Filter before the Side-Chain processing happens(or if Side-Chain is turned off)<br>
									<u>Resonance</u> adjusts the Gain Boost at the Cutoff Frequency<br>
									-Both of these parameters can be adjusted with the knobs, or by dragging the Yellow ball around the grid<br>
									<br>

									6. Envelope Parameters<br>
									<u>Envelope</u> specifies how far the Cutoff Frequency will be moved<br>
									-When at 0, top and center, the Auto Filter will not react or move<br>
									-When moved counterclockwise towards -127, the Cutoff Frequency will be decreased <br>
									-When moved clockwise towards 127, the Cutoff Frequency will be increased<br>
									<u>Attack</u> specifies how long it will take the Cutoff Frequency to move the amount specified by the ‘Envelope’ parameter<br>
									<u>Release</u> specifies how long it will take the Cutoff Frequency to return to the position specified by ‘Frequency’ and ‘Resonance’ parameters<br>
									<br>

									7. Experiment!<br>
									Throw a low-pass filter on the master track and side-chain it to the kick!<br>

									<h2>Creative Side-Chaining and Envelope Following Part 3: Gating</h2>

								</header>

								<p>
									1. Configure ‘Chainer’ and ‘Chained’ signal(s). <br>
									Sounds that have short attack-times, like kick and snare drums, work really well for ‘Chainer’ signals.<br>
									Longer sounds like guitar, keyboards, synths, and reverbs work well as ‘Chained’ signals.<br>
									Grouping multiple Audio and MIDI tracks together, Command-G, will allow you to make the effect more obvious.<br>
									<br>

									2. Put the Gate Audio Effect on the ‘Chained’ track or group<br>
									<br>

									3. Routing within the Gate<br>
									Press the Arrow icon in the top left of the Gate Audio Effect<br>
									Press the ‘SideChain’ button, it is On when the button is Yellow<br>
									In the dropdown menu, select the ‘Chainer’ track<br>
									<br>

									4. Input Parameters<br>
									<u>Threshold</u> determines the minimum amplitude value at which the Gate will open<br>
									<u>Return</u> sets the value at which the Gate will close.  This amplitude value is relative to the Threshold value, <br>
									<u>Flip</u> reverses the Gate’s On/Off status.  When the input/‘Chainer signal exceeds the set Threshold, the Gate is now turned Off instead of On<br>
									<br>

									5. Envelope Parameters<br>
									<u>Attack</u> specifies how long it will take for the ‘Chained’ signal to reach its full amplitude<br>
									<u>Hold</u> specifies how long this amplitude will be sustained<br>
									<u>Release</u> specifies the time it will take for the amplitude to return to its ‘Floor’ value once the Gate has been closed<br>
									<u>Floor</u> specifies a resting amplitude for the ‘Chained’ signal.  If you do not want to hear it at all, set it to negative infinity.<br>
									<br>

									6. Experiment!<br>
									Set up multiple ‘Chained’ tracks/groups, put identical Gates on each of them(Copy and Paste with Command-C), select Flip on some of them...<br>
									<br>
									<br>


									Traditionally, gates are used to clean up an electric signal by removing the low-level hum that is present whenever a noisy guitar or keyboard is plugged in.  This is done by setting the amplitude threshold of the gate above the amplitude of this hum.  When the player strums, plucks, or hits a key, the instrument’s output volume, a significantly louder sound than that of the hum, open’s the gate and the signal is let through.  Similar to the Side-Chain Compression tutorial, the method I described is more of a creative technique that might get you some interesting results.

									<h2>Creative Side-Chaining and Envelope Following Part 2: Compression</h2>

								</header>

								<p>
								1. Configure ‘Chainer’ and ‘Chained’ signal(s).<br>
								-Sounds that have short attack-times, like kick and snare drums, work really well for ‘Chainer’ signals.<br>
								-Longer sounds like guitar, keyboards, synths, and reverbs work well as ‘Chained’ signals.<br>
								-Grouping multiple Audio and MIDI tracks together, Command-G, will allow you to make the effect more obvious.<br>
								<br>

								2. Put a Compressor Audio Effect on the ‘Chained’ track or group<br>
								<br>

								3. Routing within the Compressor<br>
								Press the Arrow icon in the top left of the Compressor Audio Effect<br>
								Press the ‘SideChain’ button, it is On when the button is Yellow<br>
								In the dropdown menu, select the ‘Chainer’ track<br>
								<br>

								4. Compression Parameters<br>
								<u>Threshold</u> sets the minimum amplitude value that will be compressed.  Frequency content from the ‘Chained’ signal that is louder than the ‘Threshold’ value will have compression applied to it.<br>
								<u>Output</u> applies gain to the signal after it has been compressed<br>
								<u>Ratio</u> determines how much compression will be applied when the signal’s amplitude is above the threshold<br>
								<br>

								5. Envelope Parameters<br>
								<u>Attack</u> specifies how fast the amplitude/output level of ‘Chained’ signal will be decreased<br>
								<u>Release</u> specifies how long it will take the ‘Chained’ signal to return to normal amplitude/output<br>
								<br>


								6. Input Parameters<br>
								<u>Gain</u> adjusts how much the ‘Chainer’ signal will affect the Compressor<br>
								<u>EQ</u> allows you to specify which frequencies of the ‘Chainer’ signal will apply Side-Chain compression<br>
								-To Side-Chain everything to a kick drum, Select the Low-Pass Filter Type and set the Cutoff Frequency to 100 Hz<br>
								<br>

								7. Experiment!<br>
								For very extreme effects, you can side-chain the master stereo output track to a single track!<br>
								You can also mute the ‘Chainer’ track<br>
								<br>
								<br>


								Traditionally, side-chain compression has been used to achieve greater control in a mix.  For instance, side-chaining the bass to the kick drum prevents the mix from becoming muddy and potentially out of phase in that frequency area.  The approach I described above is more of a creative and reactive approach that might give you unnatural and extreme results.  I would approach side-chain compression for mixing purposes a little bit differently.  (Hopefully that tutorial will be ready soon!)

									<h2>Creative Side-Chaining and Envelope Following Part 1: Overview</h2>

								</header>

								<p>
									These videos will show you the different types of side-chaining and envelope-following you can do in Ableton Live 9.7.<br>
									<br>
									This video was written for Ableton 9.7; previous (and future) versions may require a few different steps.<br>
									<br>
									<br>

									Part 1:  Three side-chaining methods<br>
									<br>
									Side-chaining (or envelope-following) involves manipulating one audio source, with the amplitude of another audio source.  The term ‘side-chaining’ is used when dealing with compressors, gates, or filters.  Side-chaining has traditionally been used to add more control to a mix, but it can also be used to make very interesting, reactive, and unnatural things happen.  <br>
									<br>

									For the rest of these videos, I will refer to the audio signal being affected by side-chaining as the ‘Chained’ signal, and the influencing audio signal as the ‘Chainer.’  The Chained signal is affected/influenced/manipulated by the Chainer.<br>
									<br>
									<br>


									<u>Side-chain compression</u>:  Compressors limit the dynamic range of an audio signal by decreasing the louder amplitudes and increasing the quieter amplitudes.  When side-chained compression is applied, the Chained signal’s amplitude is temporarily decreased as the Chainer’s amplitude is louder than a specified threshold.  <br>
									<br>

									<u>Gating</u>:  Gates operate like on/off switches that use a signal’s amplitude to determine the switch’s on/off status. The user specifies an amplitude threshold, which determines if the audio signal will be passed through or not.  When the audio’s amplitude is below the threshold it will not be passed through, but if its amplitude is above the threshold, it will.  When a Chained audio signal is ‘Gated’ to a different Chainer signal, the chained signal will be switch on or off based on the Chainer’s amplitude.<br>
									<br>

									<u>Filtering</u>:  Filters (called the Auto Filter in Ableton) decrease the amplitude of an audio signal’s specified frequency ranges.  High-pass filters decrease the amplitude of frequencies below a specified cutoff, allowing only the frequencies above the cutoff to be sounded.  Low-pass filters do the opposite, decreasing the amplitude of frequencies above the cutoff.  The cutoff of a filter on a Chained audio signal can be increased or decreased temporarily based on the amplitude of Chainer's signal.<br>
									<br>

										<h2>Quantizing MIDI and Adjusting the Quantization Settings</h2>

									</header>

									<p>
										This video will show you how to quantize MIDI notes and how can adjust your quantization settings.<br>
										<br>
										This video was written for Ableton 9.7; previous (and future) versions may require a few different steps.<br>
										<br>
										<br>

										1. Load a MIDI instrument and MIDI clip you would like to edit.<br>
										<br>


										2. Select the portion you would like quantized<br>
										-Click and drag will select only the highlighted notes<br>
										-Command-A will select all notes within the clip<br>
										<br>

										3. Quantize by pressing Command-U<br>
										<br>

										4. Open you Quantization Settings by pressing Shift-Command-U<br>
										<br>

										5. Configure these parameters:<br>
										<br>
										<u>Quantize To</u>: Gives you a dropdown menu of the available grids<br>
										-I would leave this setting as ‘Current Grid’ and use the Command 1, 2 and 3 Ableton Shortcuts<br>
										-Command-1 Narrows the MIDI Grid<br>
										-Command-2 Widens the MIDI Grid<br>
										-Command-3 Toggles the Grid to Triplet Divisions<br>
										<br>

										<u>Adjust Note</u>: Allow you select which part(s) of the part of the MIDI you would like to quantize.<br>
										Generally, you will want to quantize the ‘Start’ of the MIDI notes only<br>
										<br>

										<u>Amount</u>: This specifies the percentage at which the selected MIDI notes will move towards the grid you are quantizing to.<br>
										0% would not shift the MIDI notes at all<br>
										100% snaps all MIDI notes exactly to the selected grid<br>
										<br>
										I like to keep mine at 50%.  This allows me to find a nice balance between my raw(perhaps sloppy), unquantized playing, and the rigid, robotic effect of complete quantization.  Keeping the ‘Quantization Amount’ at 50% also allows you to easily get closer and closer to your desired feel by pressing Command-U a few times, instead of opening your Quantization Settings every time.<br>
										<br>

										<h2>Recording MIDI Notes after the Arpeggiator</h2>

									</header>


									<!-- <div class="videoWrapper">

									</div> -->
									<p>
									This video will show you how to record the MIDI notes after they have been arpeggiated.  By default, Ableton records the input note and parameter information, not the notes that are being generated by the Arpeggiator MIDI Effect.  This technique can be applied to Ableton’s other MIDI Effects too.<br>
									<br>
									This video was written for Ableton 9.7; previous (and future) versions may require a few different steps.<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									1. Load a MIDI track, a MIDI instrument, and an Arpeggiator<br>
									-I will be using Ableton’s Operator Synth for this tutorial<br>
									<br>

									2. Find a Arpeggiator Setting you like, record a MIDI clip<br>
									-Notice that the MIDI clip contains only the held notes, not the faster notes we are hearing<br>
									<br>

									3. Add another MIDI track<br>
									-Rename tracks to ‘Sender’ and ‘Receiver’<br>
									<br>


									4. Separate the MIDI Effect from the Instrument and Audio Effects<br>
									-Remove the MIDI Instrument and any Audio Effects from the ‘Sender’ track<br>
									-Copy them to the ‘Receiver’ MIDI track<br>
									-Make sure the Arpeggiator is on the ‘Sender’ track<br>
									<br>

									5. Internal MIDI Routing<br>
									-In the ‘MIDI To’ dropdown menu, select ‘Receiver’<br>
									-Select ‘In’ for the Monitoring Mode<br>
									-This sets the ‘Receiver’ track to constantly listen for any MIDI information coming from the ‘Sender’ track<br>
									<br>

									6. Arm and Record<br>
									-You can record the MIDI clips before and after the Arpeggiator<br>
									<br>

										<h2>Saving Custom Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

									</header>


									<!-- <div class="videoWrapper">

									</div> -->
									<p>
										This video will show you how to create custom keyboard shortcuts and then save them in a Default Set for future use.  Customizing your keyboard shortcuts in Ableton Live will allow to speed up your work flow.  Here are the shortcuts I have used and found incredibly helpful over the past few years:
									<br>
									<br>
										“1 - 9” - Trigger correlating scene<br>
										“ , ” comma - Stop playback<br>
										“ . ” period - Stop all Clips in Session View<br>
										“ / ” forward slash - Back to Arrangement View<br>
										“ ‘ ” apostrophe - Reenable Automation in Arrangement View<br>
										“ ; ” semi-colon - Loop Region On/Off<br>
										“ t ” - Metronome On/Of<br>
										“ y ” - Tap Tempo<br>
										<br>
										This video was written for Ableton 9.7; previous (and future) versions may require a few different steps.<br>
										<br>
										<br>

										1. Open up a Blank Session.<br>
										-Do NOT ignore this step!<br>
										<br>

										2. Create the Audio, MIDI, and Return tracks you would like in Default Session<br>
										<br>

										3. Open up ‘Key May Mode’<br>
										-Press the 'Key' icon or press ‘Command-K’ to view parameters you can give shortcuts<br>
										<br>

										4. Assign keyboard shortcuts<br>
										-Select item you want a shortcut for<br>
										-Press keyboard key you want to use as a shortcut<br>
										-Repeat until you have all keyboard shortcuts you like<br>
										<br>

										5. Save this set as you default<br>
										-Open Ableton Preferences via the MenuBar or by pressing ‘Command- ,’<br>
										-Select the ‘File Folder’ tab on the left<br>
										-Click ‘Save’ for the ‘Save Current Set as Default Set’ option<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										Things to consider:<br>
										<br>
										If you use Ableton’s ‘Computer MIDI Keyboard’ Mode (Shift-Command-K) to input MIDI notes, consider how a mis-typed key might affect your workflow.  For instance, if you make ‘ q ’ the keyboard shortcut to ‘Stop’ global playback, accidentally pressing ‘ q ’ when using ‘Computer MIDI Keyboard’ Mode to play/input notes ‘ a ’ or ‘ w ’ will stop playback and potentially ruin a good take if you are recording.<br>
										<br>
										When you save the current set to you ‘Default Set,’ only new projects will contain these custom keyboard shortcuts.  If you would like to use them on existing projects, you will need to add them manually again.  Ableton does this to protect you from deleting shortcuts or MIDI mappings you may have made in that particular project.<br>

										<h2>Splitting a Stereo Track to Left and Right Channels</h2>

									</header>


									<!-- <div class="videoWrapper">
										<iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15MnoMdtjow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									</div> -->



									<p>
										This Ableton Project and Audio Effect Rack will allow you to split a stereo file, isolating the right and left channels.  This video was written for Ableton 9.7; previous (and future) versions may require a few different steps.
											<br>
											<br>


									1. Import your stereo audio file to an empty Audio Track
									<br>
									<br>
									2. Setup the Tracks<br>
									-Create 3 Audio Tracks; rename them 1-Stereo, 2-Left and 3-Right
									<br>
									<br>
									3. Create reusable ‘Stereo Splitter’ Audio Effect Rack<br>
									-Bring in an Empty Audio Effect Rack to the 1-Stereo Track, rename it ‘Stereo Splitter’<br>
									-Create Two “Chains” by dragging in two instances of Ableton’s Utility Audio Effect, rename them ‘Left’ and ‘Right’<br>
									-In First Chain/Utility, select ‘Left’ in the Utility-Channel Mode dropdown menu<br>
									-In Second Chain/Utility, select ‘Right’ in the Utility-Channel Mode dropdown menu<br>
									-(optional) Press the Floppy Disc Icon and save to your User Library
									<br>
									<br>
									4. Internal Routing<br>
									-On the 2-Left track, adjust both ‘Audio From’ dropdown menus<br>
									-From ‘Ext. In’ to ‘1-Stereo’<br>
									-From ‘1’ to ‘Stereo Splitter | Left | Post FX’<br>
									-Set the Channel Monitor to ‘Auto’
									<br>
									<br>
									-On the 3-Right track, adjust both ‘Audio From’ dropdown menus<br>
									-From ‘Ext. In’ to ‘1-Stereo’<br>
									-From ‘1’ to ‘Stereo Splitter | Right | Post FX’<br>
									-Set the Channel Monitor to ‘Auto’
									<br>
									<br>
									5. Pan and Arm 2-Left and 3-Right tracks<br>
									-Hard pan the 2-Left completely to the left, and the 3-Right track completely to the right<br>
									-To arm multiple tracks, Command-click
									<br>
									<br>
									6. Check to make sure everything is working<br>
									-Mute the 1-Stereo track<br>
									-If 2-Left and 3-Right do not play, or if they are the same, you have likely made an error somewhere in the steps above
									<br>
									<br>
									7. Record<br>
									-In 2-Left and 3-Right, set empty clips to record<br>
									-Launch you stereo file/clip on 1-Stereo
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									Things to consider:  <br>
									<br>
									This is not a perfect solution.  This method does not leave you with two mono tracks, but rather gives you two distinct stereo files that contain identical right and left information.  Notice that both the 2-Left and 3-Right tracks display stereo meters, not a single mono meter.
									<br>
									<br>
									Consider using Audacity, it allows you to split stereo files to mono files with a single right-click.
